- search by product name/description
- sort by rating

This is a solo project - github automatically added the instructor as a co-contributor who set up the original private repository under Integrify Academy github account for ease of turning in the assignment. The codes were otherwise written independently.

REST API used: https://fakestoreapi.com/

Note: Not connected to an actual backend (cannot process cart checkout or faked payment).
